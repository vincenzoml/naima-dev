# Naima

**Website: [vincenzoml.github.io/naima](https://vincenzoml.github.io/naima/)**

Naima is a silent software house of AI agents: it turns vibe coding into an exact science. Vibe coding — asking an AI to build software and hoping it worked — leaves work unverified, unrecorded, unrepeatable, uncoordinated and roleless; Naima replaces each with its opposite. You say what you want. Agents build it with industry-grade practice — written [requirements](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#requirement), tests, [metrics](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#metric), reviews, [gates](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#gate) before anything ships — and with [formal methods](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#formal-methods), properties of the design proven by tools, all applied for you without your needing to know them. Every [claim](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#claim) comes with its [evidence](naima/docs/guide/glossary.md#evidence): nothing counts as done until it is shown to be. You only decide.

Born for software, it runs any other project too, with that work's own checks in place of tests: a data analysis checked by reproducible runs, a paper written with colleagues checked by reviews.
Naima lives in a folder of your project and manages it with git, so you never have to.

**You don't need to know git, code or project management. You need an AI agent — Naima does the rest.**

Code-quality metrics — complexity, duplication, coverage and more — are
measured per commit and shown beside the tests; see your project's in a
native window with `naima ui`
([metrics and budgets](naima/docs/guide/metrics-and-budgets.md)).

## Install

In the root of a git repository, one line. It sets up everything it needs:
it installs [Deno](https://deno.com) when it is missing, and says how to
install git if that is missing.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://vincenzoml.github.io/naima/install.sh | sh     # macOS, Linux
irm https://vincenzoml.github.io/naima/install.ps1 | iex          # Windows PowerShell
```

Or ask your agent: *Please install https://github.com/vincenzoml/naima in the root of this repository; create a repository at the root if missing.*

### If you are the agent asked to install it

If git is not installed, install it (macOS: `xcode-select --install`, or `brew install git` with Homebrew; Linux: the package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install git`; Windows: `winget install Git.Git`), then work in the
root of this repository (if it is not a git repository yet, create one at the
root with `git init`; `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints the root), and do
these steps in order.

1. Run the installer line above for this system. It clones Naima into
   `naima-tracker/naima/` (ignored by git), writes the rest of
   `naima-tracker/` and nothing else, and checks it. Outside a git repository
   it refuses.
2. Check it: `deno run -A naima-tracker/naima/naima.ts check` must end with
   `all invariants hold`.
3. Commit it: `git add naima-tracker && git commit -m "Track this project with Naima"`.
4. Read `naima-tracker/naima/skills/naima/SKILL.md` and work by it, and read
   the project's rules: `naima rules --audience agents`. Here `naima` means
   `deno run -A naima-tracker/naima/naima.ts`.
5. Add this line, verbatim, to the agent instruction file this repository
   has — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or whichever file you read; if there is none,
   create `AGENTS.md` — and commit it:

   ```text
   This repository tracks its work with Naima: at the start of every session read naima-tracker/naima/skills/naima/SKILL.md and `naima rules --audience agents`, and work by them.
   ```

By hand, without the installer — Deno first, if `deno --version` does not
answer: [Deno by hand](naima/README.md#deno-by-hand), for macOS, Linux and
Windows, does what Deno's own installer does, for your user only. Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vincenzoml/naima.git naima-tracker/naima
deno run -A naima-tracker/naima/naima.ts init
deno run -A naima-tracker/naima/naima.ts check
```

## Documentation

**[The documentation map](naima/docs/README.md)** — where to start, by who you are:

- **[purpose](naima/docs/purpose.md)**: why Naima exists and whom it serves: born for software, then any project;
- **[the guide](naima/docs/guide/README.md)**, for people: a
  [tutorial](naima/docs/guide/tutorial.md), a page per everyday task,
  [installing and updating](naima/docs/guide/install.md), and
  **[the rules](naima/docs/guide/rules.md)** every project holds to;
- **[for agents](naima/docs/agents/README.md)**: the skill and the flows;
- **reference**: [the format](naima/docs/reference/format.md) of every file,
  and [every command and field](naima/docs/reference/reference.md);
- **[developing Naima](develop/README.md)**, and the rules for working on this
  repository: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Why the name

**Coltrane.** *Naima* is John Coltrane's ballad on *Giant Steps* (1959). It is
built on pedal points: bass notes that hold still while the harmony above them
keeps moving. That is the architecture here — a small core that does not move,
and everything built on it free to change. It comes from the album where
Coltrane took harmonic rigour furthest, and it is the calmest, simplest piece
on it: rigour and beauty in the same place.

**Anima.** *Naima* is an anagram of *anima*, the soul: what makes a thing alive
from the inside. The tool is not the project; it is what keeps the project
alive and coherent as it grows.

**AI.** The name contains it. The work this tool organises is done more and
more by agents, and the tool is designed for them as much as for people.

**The word.** In Arabic, *naʿīma* means grace and calm. Five letters, said the
same way in every language, nothing to explain.
