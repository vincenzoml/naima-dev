# Working on Naima

For anyone, person or agent, who changes this repository. Short on purpose:
each rule links the page that holds its reasoning.

## The owner's two rules

1. **Don't ask the human if you know the answer.** Decide, act, report. Ask
   only for what is genuinely the owner's: a judgement of how something looks
   or feels, a decision reserved to them, a credential, a physical act. A
   question you could have answered yourself spends the most expensive
   resource in the project. How to tell the two apart:
   [asking the human](docs/flows/asking-the-human.md).
2. **Features are documented always, as part of their implementation.** A
   feature is not done until its documentation is in the same change. For a
   plugin contribution that means its manifest carries the documentation (a
   command its usage, options and an example; a gate how it decides) and
   `docs/reference.md` is regenerated with `npm run docs`; for anything else,
   the page under `docs/` that explains it. `npm run verify` fails otherwise:
   [the documentation rule](docs/documentation.md).

## Working rules

- **Naima tracks itself, and the tracker is managed by the pinned stable.**
  `npm run naima -- <command>` runs the tagged release named in
  `package.json` (`naimaStable`); `npm run naima:dev -- <command>` runs the
  working tree, as a test. Every tracker change goes through the CLI, never by
  hand. A change to the item format ships in a stable before the development
  version writes it: [bootstrap policy](docs/bootstrap.md).
- **Write it down before fixing it.** A defect, a task or a request becomes an
  item first (`naima new`), then gets worked on. A fix with no trace is
  diagnosed from scratch next time: [reporting and triage](docs/flows/reporting-and-triage.md).
- **Triage what you touch.** An item you open, report or fix leaves with
  `impact`, `priority` and `confidence` set; `effort` is set only by someone
  who has looked at the code, never guessed.
- **Fixed, resolved, closed are three states.** Fixed: the code exists
  (`fixedOn`). Resolved: fixed and proven by an item that `verifies` it and has
  passed. Closed: resolved and archived with its proof (`naima close`). A
  branch does not close its own items on the strength of its own tests.
- **One isolated worktree per piece of work.** A worktree writes to its own
  branch and nowhere else; no shared mutable file — a registry is a directory
  of files named by uuid: [worktree isolation](docs/flows/worktree-isolation.md).
- **Every merge to the trunk is `git merge --ff-only`.** If it fails, stop:
  the resolution belongs on the branch, after merging the trunk into it:
  [closing a worktree](docs/flows/closing-a-worktree.md).
- **Evidence travels with the claim.** "It works" without a number, a log line
  or an attachment is not a verification.
- **English**, in code, docs, items and commit messages.

## Before pushing

```sh
npm run verify    # typecheck, tests, check (dev and stable), reference current
```

Architecture and the dependency rule: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
