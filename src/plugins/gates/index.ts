// Gates: named release or merge conditions, backed by items.
//
// A gate is the set of items that must be settled before something may
// happen. It is configured, never hard-coded, in this plugin's options in the
// project's naima-tracker/naima-data/naima.json:
//
//   "plugins": { "gates": { "options": { "gates": {
//     "v1": { "title": "First public release", "says": "…", "holdsOn": "code" } } } } }
//
// holdsOn "code"  (default) the gate waits for code, not for proof: an item
//                 that is fixed and owes only its proving gesture, and the
//                 gestures themselves, are owed but do not block — unless
//                 refuted: a failed test, a violated property, blocks.
// holdsOn "proof" every open item on the gate blocks it.
//
// Any plugin may contribute gates through the contract; `naima gates` lists
// them all, whoever declared them.
