// The plugin API: everything a plugin may use of the core, and nothing else.
// A plugin inside the program imports it from this file; any plugin — one a
// project pins from outside the program too — receives the same functions as
// the second argument of its factory, with its own scope, and so needs no
// import at all. Everything the entry point, the loader and the tests use
// besides is in ./internal.ts, which no plugin may import: src/arch.test.ts holds it.
