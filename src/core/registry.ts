// Merging plugin manifests into one registry.
//
// Every kind of contribution is an extension point, declared as data: the
// core's own (core/points.ts) and any a plugin declares. A plugin contributes
// to a point under its id in `contributes`, or under the same key at the top
// of its manifest. Nothing here knows what a point's contributions mean
// beyond the core's own points, whose cross-references it resolves.
//
// Every contribution has a qualified id, `<plugin>/<name>`, unique whatever
// other plugins declare, and a short name it goes by: its declared name, or
// the one the project's `rename` gives it. A short name works while it stays
// unambiguous. A point whose names are written into the data cannot have two
// contributions by one name, since both would be stored under it: that is an
// error at load time, resolved by renaming one. Any other point's names may
// be shared; the short name then stops resolving, and the qualified id names
// each.
