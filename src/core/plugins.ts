// Which plugins a project loads, and from where: every first-party plugin
// unless the project switches it off or replaces it, then every third-party
// plugin its `plugins` table adds.
//
// Code runs from three places, each pinned so that what runs is what the
// project reviewed: a path inside the program (the program is locked), a file
// in the project pinned by its sha256, or a module in a git repository pinned
// by commit, fetched once into the tracker folder. Never from a package, and
// never from the data. Every manifest says the contract it was written for,
// and every factory receives the plugin API with its own scope, so a plugin
// from outside the program needs no import of the core.
