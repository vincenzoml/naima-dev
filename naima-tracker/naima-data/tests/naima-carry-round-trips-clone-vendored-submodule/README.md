# naima carry round-trips clone, vendored, submodule, clone

## Gesture

From a committed clone-mode host: `naima carry vendored`, commit, `naima check`; `naima carry submodule`, commit, `naima check`; `naima carry clone`, commit, `naima check`.

Pass: each switch is staged whole (the tree is clean after one commit) and `check` passes; vendored, the program is committed with no `.git` and no `.gitignore` line; as a submodule, the index holds a gitlink at the locked commit and `.gitmodules` names `naima-tracker/naima`; back to a clone, `.gitmodules` is gone, `.gitignore` is `/naima/` and nothing under `naima/` is tracked; in every mode the program's code is the locked commit's.
