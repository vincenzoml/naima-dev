# Plugin contract

The interfaces are in [`src/core/types.ts`](../src/core/types.ts); this page
says what each part is for.

## Shape

```ts
import type { Plugin, PluginScope } from "../src/core/index.ts"   // a path inside the program

export default function myPlugin(options: Record<string, unknown>, scope: PluginScope): Plugin {
  return { name: scope.plugin, says: "one line", /* contributions */ }
}
```

The first-party plugins are loaded unless the project switches one off or
replaces it. A third-party plugin is added under `plugins` in `naima.json`,
by the path of its module inside the program — a fork of Naima that carries
it — with optional `options`; a first-party plugin takes its options, and its
replacement, the same way ([configuration](config.md#the-plugins-table)):

```json
{ "plugins": { "mine": { "source": "plugins/mine.ts", "options": {} }, "docs": { "options": { "reference": "docs/reference.md" } } } }
```

A plugin is registered under the name its entry has. The factory is called
with the entry's `options`; a plugin that carries migrations must accept the
options as they stand before its own migrations run, since it is loaded then
to collect them.

## Contributions

Every kind of contribution is an **extension point**: the core declares its
own, a plugin may declare more, and any plugin contributes to any point that
some loaded plugin declares. A contribution goes under the point's id in
`contributes`; for the core's points, the same key at the top of the manifest
says the same thing and is typed.

| Part | What it declares |
|---|---|
| `says` | one line: what the plugin is (required) |
| `about` | longer markdown: the concepts a reader needs before the reference |
| `options` | the keys the plugin reads from its `options`: `name`, `says`, `default` (a first-party plugin infers each default from the repository) |
| `points` | extension points it declares ([below](#extension-points)) |
| `contributes` | contributions to any point, by point id: `{ "gates": [...] }` |
| `optional` | points it contributes to only when some loaded plugin declares them; without one those contributions are dropped instead of refused |
| `uses` | what it reads that another plugin declares, by point: `{ fields: ["fixedOn"], relations: ["verifies"] }` ([below](#cooperation-without-imports)) |

The core's points, each also a typed key of the manifest:

| Point | What a contribution is |
|---|---|
| `commands` | `naima <name>`: `says`, `usage`, `options` (one per `--flag` in the usage), `examples` (invocations without the leading `naima`); `run(args, ctx)` returns an exit code (may be async) |
| `types` | item types: `id`, `dir`, `statuses` (each `open` or `done`, with open-ended `flags`; `proves` — evidence for what the item verifies — and `refutes` — evidence against it, which blocks a gate and a close — are two, also said as keys), `initialStatus`, a README `template`, `creatable: false` for archives, plain `traits`, an optional `transitions` map ([extending](#extending-another-plugins-types-and-fields)) |
| `fields` | fields with a kind (`string`, `strings`, `date`, `enum`, `boolean`, `number`, `object`), enum values in rank order — or `valuesFrom` a point, and `multiple` for several — and the types they apply to, by name (`appliesTo`) or by trait (`traits`); `configured: true` when the values come from the project's configuration, so the program's reference does not list them |
| `extends` | additive changes to another plugin's types and fields ([extending](#extending-another-plugins-types-and-fields)) |
| `relations` | link relations; each names its inverse, which must also be declared |
| `checks` | `run(ctx) → Finding[]`; `problem` fails `naima check`, `note` does not; the project may weigh each one `off`, `note` or `problem` ([check severity](config.md#check-severity)) |
| `views` | `naima view <name>`: a named rendering of derived state |
| `dirs` | directories under the tracker root the plugin owns that are not item types |
| `summary` | a block of `naima summary` |
| `rank` | an additive urgency term; lower is more urgent |
| `hooks` | [write hooks](#write-hooks): `beforeWrite(write, ctx)`, which may change what is written or refuse it, and `afterWrite(write, ctx)`, on every item write |
| `migrations` | its own data migrations, in order from its format 1: `from`, `says`, and pure `config(raw)`, `item(meta)`, `stale(meta)`; its format is 1 + their number ([migrations](format.md#migrations)) |

First-party plugins declare two more: the `gates` plugin declares `gates` (a
named condition: `title`, `says`, `decides`, `evaluate(ctx) → { holds,
blocking, owed }`), the `verifier` plugin `verifiers`
([below](#the-verifier-contract)). The [reference](reference.md#extension-points)
lists every point with who declares it and who contributes to it.

A contribution to a point no loaded plugin declares, and any manifest key the
contract does not know, is refused when the project loads: a misspelt key is
never silently ignored.

## Extension points

A point is data: an `ExtensionPoint` in [`src/core/types.ts`](../src/core/types.ts).

```ts
const notifiersPoint: ExtensionPoint<Notifier> = {
  id: "notifiers",                       // the key under contributes, and the kind of qualified ids
  says: "somewhere to send a message",
  noun: "notifier",                      // one contribution, in words
  key: (n) => n.name,                    // the name a contribution goes by
  stored: false,                         // true when its names are written into the data
  renamed: (n, name) => ({ ...n, name }),     // a copy under a project's rename
  validate: (v) => typeof (v as Notifier)?.notify === "function" ? null : "has no notify function",
  gaps: (n) => n.says ? [] : ["does not say where it sends"],   // what the docs check reports
  document: (ns) => ns.map((n) => `- ${n.name}: ${n.says}`),    // its lines in the reference
}

export default (): Plugin => ({ name: "notify", says: "…", points: [notifiersPoint], commands: [/* reads ctx.registry.contributions("notifiers") */] })
// and in any other plugin:
export default (): Plugin => ({ name: "chat", says: "…", contributes: { notifiers: [{ name: "room", says: "the team room", notify: (m) => … }] } })
```

A point's contributions are read with `ctx.registry.contributions(id)` —
each with its qualified id, the name it goes by, and whose it is — and one by
name with `ctx.registry.find(id, ref)`. A contribution `validate` refuses is
refused when the project loads; `configured(c)` marks one the project's
configuration makes, which the program's reference leaves out. The core's own
points are declared exactly this way (`src/core/points.ts`): adding a kind
of contribution never takes a change to the core. The on-disk layout is not
a point: `<type>/<slug>/{README.md,meta.json,attachments/}` is the
compatibility boundary between forks ([the format](format.md)).

## Extending another plugin's types and fields

Data only: no type derives from another, and nothing is overridden. Three
mechanisms, used together:

- **Traits.** A type carries plain tags, `traits: ["fixable"]`, and a field
  declared with `traits: ["fixable"]` applies to every type that carries one,
  whoever declares it. `fixedOn` applies to every `fixable` type: the
  `trackers` plugin's bugs, todos, features and archive, and a third-party
  `incidents` type that says it is fixable. `appliesTo` still names types
  exactly; a field with both applies to both.
- **Extensions.** A plugin — or the project, under `extends` in
  [`naima.json`](format.md#naimajson) — adds to a type it does not own:
  statuses, traits, transitions; or to a field: enum values, more types or
  traits it applies to. It never redefines: a status it names that exists
  keeps its category (open stays open), its flags only grow, and a field
  keeps its kind. Refused otherwise, when the project loads.

  ```ts
  extends: [
    { type: "bugs", statuses: { blocked: { category: "open", flags: ["waiting"], says: "waiting on another team" } } },
    { field: "runBy", values: { pager: "settled by whoever holds the pager" }, appliesTo: ["incidents"] },
  ]
  ```
- **Flags and transitions.** A status's `flags` are open-ended tags any
  plugin may give meaning to and any plugin may read (`hasFlag(ctx, item,
  "waiting")`); `proves` and `refutes` are the two the first-party plugins
  read. A type's optional `transitions` maps a status to those it may move
  to; a status it does not name moves to any. The core's `status-moves` write
  hook holds it on every write, and a forced write takes the move on.

A field whose enum values are the names of a point's contributions says
`valuesFrom`: the `gate` field takes its values from every gate contributed
to the `gates` point, and with `multiple: true` an item may hold one value as
a string or several as a list (`naima set <item> gate=v1,v2`).

## Names

Every contribution has a **qualified id**, `<plugin>/<name>` — `trackers/fixedOn`,
`triage/next` — unique among its kind whatever other plugins declare, and a
**short name** it goes by: the name it declares, or the one the project's
`rename` gives it. Stored data keeps short names: a `meta.json` holds
`fixedOn`, never `trackers/fixedOn`.

- **A name that only runs** — a command, a view, a check, a summary section,
  a rank term, a write hook — may be declared by several plugins. Each still runs, and
  `naima plugins` shows its qualified id; its short name stops resolving the
  moment a second plugin declares it, with an error naming both qualified ids
  (`naima ops/list`, `naima view ops/next`).
- **A name stored in the data** — a type (and its directory), a field, a
  relation, a directory, a gate, a verifier — cannot be declared twice, since
  both would be written under it. Loading refuses, naming both qualified ids
  and the rename that resolves it:

```json
{ "rename": { "fields": { "ops/priority": "severity" } } }
```

`rename` maps an extension point's id (`types`, `fields`, `relations`,
`dirs`, `gates`, `verifiers`, `commands`, `views`, `checks`, `summary`,
`rank`, `hooks`, or any point a plugin declares with `renamed`) to qualified
ids and the short name each goes by instead. A renamed type's directory
follows its new name, and a relation's inverse follows its relation. A plugin
reads its own names through the `scope` its factory receives —
`scope.name("fields", "priority")` is `severity` in the project above — so a
rename never hides its own data from it. The core and the first-party
plugins read their names as declared, so only a third-party plugin's
contributions can be renamed; a rename naming anything no loaded plugin
declares is refused.

A command named after one the entry point answers before any plugin loads
(`init`, `update`, `carry`, `guide`, `help`) is refused too: it could never
run.

**Documentation is part of the manifest.** Every `says`, every example and
every option entry is what `naima docs` turns into the reference, and with the
`docs` plugin loaded `naima check` fails on a contribution that lacks its own:
[the documentation rule](documentation.md).

## The context

Every hook receives a `Context`: the project `root`, the data directory
`trackerRoot` and its path from the root `trackerDir`, the `program` directory
(never part of the project's files: pass it to `projectFiles`), the
`config`, the merged `registry`, the `repo` (items, `byId`, `resolve`,
`linksOf` with inverses), `reload()` for a change made on disk without the
helpers, `out`/`err`, and `now()`. Write through the public helpers
(`createItem`, `saveMeta`, `setFields`, `addLink`, `moveItem`, `writeJson`,
`writeFileAtomic`) so that ids and validation stay consistent, every plugin's
[write hooks](#write-hooks) run, and no crash leaves a file half written. Read a field through
`fieldValue(item, { name: "fixedOn", kind: "date" } as const)`, typed by its
kind (and `setFieldValue` to change one): the project compiles with
`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, so `item.meta.fixdOn` is an error, not a
silent `undefined`. Every write through the helpers is seen by the next read
of `repo`, with no reload to remember. The `registry` and the
`config` are frozen once the project is loaded: a plugin reads another's
contributions and cannot change them.

## Exit codes

A command's `run` returns `0` when what it did or checked holds, `1` when it
does not (a check, a gate, a verdict), and throws to refuse. The entry point
adds the rest:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | done; what was checked holds |
| `1` | done; what was checked does not hold |
| `2` | refused: bad usage, or a state the user must change first — a plain `Error`, or a `NaimaError` whose `code` says which (`usageError(cmd)` gives one with `code: "usage"`) |
| `70` | internal error: the engine's own (a `TypeError`, …) or something thrown that is not an `Error` — a bug; `NAIMA_DEBUG=1` prints its stack |
| `75` | reserved: the program asks the launcher to run it again. A command that returns it is reported as `1`, so it never runs twice |

Render anything caught with `message(e)`, never `(e as Error).message`.

## Write hooks

Every item write the core's helpers make — `createItem`, `saveMeta`,
`setFields`, `addLink`, `moveItem`, and so every command built on them (`new`,
`set`, `link`, `unlink`, `close`, `verify`, `triage`) — runs every plugin's
write hooks, in plugin load order:

```ts
hooks: [{
  name: "no-large-notes",
  says: "what it does, in one line: it is the reference",
  beforeWrite(write, ctx) {          // before anything is on disk
    if (write.item.meta["size"] === "L") return "large notes are not allowed — split it, or set size=S"
    write.item.meta["checkedOn"] = today(ctx)   // or change what is written
  },
  afterWrite(write, ctx) {},         // after it, with the item as written
}]
```

A `Write` is `{ kind, item, before, to?, force }`: `kind` is `create`,
`update` or `move`; `item` is the item as it is about to be written (on a
create its directory does not exist yet); `before` its fields as they are on
disk, `null` for a create; `to` the type a move goes to; `force` the command's
`--force`, which a hook may honour.

- **Order.** `beforeWrite` runs in load order, each hook seeing the changes
  of the hooks before it; then the write; then `afterWrite`, in the same
  order.
- **A refusal** is a returned string: a sentence saying what to do instead.
  The first one stops the write, and every later hook; nothing is on disk,
  and the helper throws a `NaimaError` (code `vetoed`, exit `2`) whose message
  is the sentence and the hook's name. A command that refuses leaves the item
  as it was in memory too.
- **A refusal with no sentence** — an empty or blank string — is a bug in the
  hook, reported as an internal error: a hook that vetoes says why.
- **Not item writes:** `writeJson` and `writeFileAtomic` on a plugin's own
  files (a claim, a run record, a session note), and the data migrations,
  which rewrite every item to a new format.

The first-party hooks — triage stamping `triagedOn`, a property reopening when
what it was verified on changes, `holds` written only by `naima verify`, and
no branch closing an item it claims — are listed in the
[reference](reference.md).

## Cooperation without imports

Plugins do not import each other. They cooperate through what they declare:
the `trackers` plugin's `close` accepts any item whose status `proves`, so a
`verifier` property that holds closes a bug exactly as a passed test does, and
refuses on any whose status `refutes`, or that a check reports; the `gates`
plugin lists every gate contributed to its `gates` point, including the
verifier's `properties` gate (a contribution the verifier makes `optional`,
so it is dropped when no gates plugin is loaded); `triage` and `gates` each add a `rank` term and the core
sums them.

What one plugin reads of another's vocabulary it declares in `uses`, by
point: the `gates` plugin uses the fields `fixedOn`, `runBy` and
`humanBecause` and the relations `verifies` and `verified-by`; `beta-markers`
uses `closedFrom`; `docs` uses its feature types. Each name must resolve —
a short name, or a qualified id — when the project loads, or loading fails
naming it and who uses it: switching off or replacing the plugin that
declares it is a loud error, never a silently empty gate. `naima plugins`
and the reference list each plugin's uses.


## The verifier contract

A verifier is an adapter to a formal-methods tool (a model checker, a
theorem prover, a spatial logic checker), contributed to the `verifier`
plugin's `verifiers` point by any plugin — `contributes: { verifiers: [myChecker] }`:

```ts
const myChecker: Verifier = {
  id: "my-checker",
  says: "what it checks, in one line",
  async verify({ model, property, options }, ctx) {
    // model: absolute path of the model file; property: in the tool's own language;
    // options: the item's `verifierOptions` object.
    return { verdict: "holds", output: "…", /* counterexample: "…" */ }
  },
}
```

| Verdict | Item status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `holds` | `holds` (proves) | the property holds on this model |
| `violated` | `violated` | the tool found a counterexample; return it as `counterexample` |
| `error` | `error` | the tool could not run or reach a verdict |
| `unknown` | `error` | the tool ran and could not decide (a bound was hit) |

**Programs it starts.** A verifier that runs an external tool declares it:
`runs: ["tlc"]` — a name looked up on `PATH`, or an absolute path; one word,
no comma. `runs` is not the verifier's alone: a contribution to any point may
declare the programs it starts, and the core collects them from every point.
The launcher allows the program exactly the declared programs, besides
`git`: it asks the program about to run (`naima runs --json`, under read
permission only) when the project loads a third-party plugin or a
replacement, since no first-party contribution starts a program. Anything
undeclared fails with Deno's own `Requires run access`.

An adapter that throws is recorded as `error` with the message as output. So
is a result outside the contract — a verdict not in the table, or no string
`output` — with an output that says what was wrong.
Map the tool's exit status and output to a verdict; never report `holds` on
a run that did not complete.

## Evidence from a verifier

A `properties` item names `verifier`, `model` (a path from the project root)
and `property`. `naima verify` runs the adapter and attaches the run —
verdict, output, the model's sha256 and the options' — plus the
counterexample as its own file. `naima check` fails when a property claims to
hold and its property, verifier, model path, options or model contents have
changed since the run. The shipped adapter, `example-regex`, is a stand-in; real
adapters are separate plugins.

## Testing a plugin

`core/testing.ts` builds a throwaway project with a fixed clock and captured
output:

```ts
const p = tempProject([myPlugin({})], { git: true })
await p.run("my-command", "arg")
assert.match(p.output.join("\n"), /expected/)
p.cleanup()
```
