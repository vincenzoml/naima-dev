# Configuration

## The automatic principle

Naima is automatic first. Every first-party plugin — `trackers`,
`coordination`, `triage`, `gates`, `beta-markers`, `verifier`, `docs` — is
loaded, and every default is inferred from the repository: beta markers are
looked for in every file git tracks (or would track), and the docs check
follows the links of every tracked markdown file. The program in
`naima-tracker/naima/` is never one of the project's files, even when it is
committed. A project that needs nothing else configures nothing.

`naima-tracker/naima-data/naima.json` holds only what the tool cannot infer:

- the **formats** of the data, and the **lock**: which Naima runs the project
  (`source`, `commit`), and how it is carried (`carry`, `program`);
- the **`plugins` table**: what the project decides about a plugin — its
  options (the project's gates are the `gates` plugin's), a plugin switched
  off or replaced, a third-party plugin added, a check weighed differently.

`naima init` writes the formats and the lock; nothing else is needed. Every
key, with its default: [the format](format.md#naimajson).

## The plugins table

`plugins` maps a plugin's name to what the project decides about it. A
first-party plugin the table does not name is loaded as it is.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "gates": { "options": { "gates": { "v1": { "title": "First release", "holdsOn": "code" } } } },
    "docs": { "options": { "reference": "docs/reference.md" }, "checks": { "links-resolve": "note" } },
    "beta-markers": { "enabled": false },
    "trackers": { "replacedBy": "plugins/my-trackers.ts" },
    "core": { "checks": { "duplicates": "problem" } },
    "mine": { "source": "plugins/mine.ts", "options": { "strict": true } }
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `options` | `{}` | the plugin's own options, as its reference documents them: the `gates` plugin's `gates`, the `docs` plugin's `reference`, `beta-markers`' `paths` |
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` switches the plugin off: it is not loaded, and nothing it declares exists |
| `replacedBy` | none | for a first-party plugin: the module that runs under its name instead — a fork, or an alternative |
| `source` | none | for a third-party plugin, required: its module (below) |
| `checks` | `{}` | check name → `off`, `note` or `problem`: how much each of the plugin's checks weighs here |

The name is the project's: a plugin is registered under the name its entry
has, whatever its manifest says, so a replacement keeps the name of what it
replaces. A name is lowercase letters, digits and dashes, starting with a
letter.

`core` is the core's own entry. The core cannot be switched off or replaced,
and takes no options; only its checks can be weighed.

### Check severity

As a linter weighs its rules, a project weighs each check: `problem` fails
`naima check`, `note` is reported and never fails it, `off` is not run. A
check the plugin does not declare is refused when the project loads, so a
misspelt name is never a silent no-op. The reference documents every check
as its plugin weighs it.

### Gates

The `gates` plugin's `gates` option maps a gate name to
`{ "title", "says", "holdsOn" }`. How a gate decides is in the
[reference](reference.md#gates). Format 1 kept it as a top-level `gates` key;
the `gates` plugin's own migration moves it here.

## Third-party plugins

Code runs only from the program, never from the data or from a package. A
third-party plugin is a module inside the program — in practice, in a fork of
Naima ([modifying Naima](install.md#modifying-naima)) — named by its path
there in its entry's `source`, with optional options:

```json
{ "plugins": { "mine": { "source": "plugins/mine.ts" }, "other": { "source": "plugins/other.ts", "options": { "strict": true } } } }
```

A path that leaves the program is refused, and so is a `source` on a
first-party name: it is already loaded, and `replacedBy` is how it is
replaced. The module's default export is a factory that takes the options and
returns the manifest ([plugin contract](plugin-contract.md)). Two plugins
declaring the same name is an error when the project loads.
