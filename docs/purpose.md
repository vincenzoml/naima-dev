# Purpose, requirements and principles

Why Naima exists, whom it serves, what it requires of itself, and the
principles behind its design. Read this first: every other page explains how
a piece works; this one says why it is shaped that way.

## Why Naima exists

Software is more and more often built by people and AI agents working in
parallel on one repository. The code is held to rigorous standards: typed,
tested, reviewed, refused by CI when it breaks. The state of the project
around the code usually is not. Which defects are open, which are fixed,
which fixes are actually proven, what a release waits on, who is working on
what: these live in a hosted database, on boards edited by hand, and in the
memory of whoever looked last.

With one person that is an inconvenience. With several agents writing at once
it causes defects of its own: two sessions overwrite one shared status file;
a board that says "fixed" is read as "done" although nothing proved the fix;
a release is cut against a list that went stale an hour ago; "how many bugs
are left" adds unfixed, unproven and archived items into one meaningless
number.

Naima holds the project state to the same standard as the code. Items are
plain files in the repository, versioned with the code they talk about. Views
are derived, never stored. "Fixed", "resolved" and "closed" are different,
checked states. Parallel sessions coordinate through git alone. And a
property proven by a formal-methods tool, a model checker say, is evidence
exactly as a passed test is: it resolves what it verifies, it expires when
its model changes, and gates wait on it. That puts a proof where engineering
decisions are made, on the board and in the release gate, instead of in a
separate world nobody reads.

## Whom it serves

- **AI agents**, first. Most of the work Naima organises is done by agents,
  often several at once, each in its own worktree. They need a tracker they
  can read and write with plain file and git operations, rules that are
  checked rather than remembered, and a way to coordinate that never makes
  two of them edit one file.
- **People**, who own the project. The owner decides what is built and
  judges what only a person can judge; Naima keeps them from being asked what
  an agent could answer itself, and shows them numbers that mean one thing.
- **Projects using formal methods**, whose properties are tracked, proven and
  gated on the same footing as their tests.
- **Forks.** Naima is meant to be changed to fit a project. Every fork that
  keeps the format works on the same data as every other.

## Requirements

Each requirement has a short name, what it means, and what holds it: the
code, check or test that fails when it is broken. Where nothing does yet, it
says so.

### Functional

**plain-files.** Every item is a directory of plain files in the repository:
`README.md` for prose, `meta.json` for fields, `attachments/` for evidence.
No database, no server. Held by: the [format](format.md#items) and its
[invariants](format.md#invariants), which `naima check` runs (readable
items, a `README.md` and a JSON `meta.json` in every item directory).

**permanent-ids.** An item's uuid never changes; its slug may. Links hold
ids, and only one direction of a link is stored, the inverse derived.
Held by: the core invariants of `naima check` (unique uuids, links naming an
existing item, [architecture](architecture.md#checks)).

**derived-views.** Boards, queues, gate states, urgency, claim tables and
summaries are computed when read and never written, so no stored copy can go
stale ([concepts](concepts.md#derived-never-stored)). Held by: the plugin
contract, in which a view or summary returns data and has no way to persist
it ([views and summaries](plugin-contract.md#views-and-summaries)). No check
looks for a stored board: not yet enforced beyond that.

**three-completion-states.** Fixed (the code exists), resolved (fixed and
proven by an item that `verifies` it and has passed) and closed (resolved and
archived with its proof) are three states, never added into one number
([concepts](concepts.md#fixed-resolved-closed)). Held by: the checks
`closed-carries-proof` (a closed item carries its proof) and
`proven-but-open`, `naima close` refusing anything not resolved, and
`src/lifecycle.test.ts`.

**proof-stays-current.** A proof counts only for what it was run on. A
property that held on a model since changed, or with a different property,
verifier or options, is no longer current, and `naima close` refuses it.
Held by: the check `property-evidence`, the write hooks
`property-reopens-when-changed` (a changed property goes back to open) and
`holds-only-by-verify` (a property holds only with a run for what it is now),
and the tests in `src/plugins/verifier/verifier.test.ts` and `src/lifecycle.test.ts`.

**verifiers-are-evidence.** A formal-methods tool plugs in as a verifier; its
run is attached as evidence with the hash of the model it ran on, and
resolves items like a passed test ([the verifier
contract](plugin-contract.md#the-verifier-contract)). Held by:
`src/plugins/verifier/verifier.test.ts` and the check `property-evidence`.

**gates.** A release or a merge is a named condition backed by items; an item
joins a gate by carrying `gate`, and may be on several. Held by: the `gates`
plugin and its tests, `src/plugins/gates/gates.test.ts`; the check
`gated-proof-is-gated`.

**no-shared-mutable-file.** Parallel sessions never edit one file. State that
belongs to no single branch, claims and session notes, is one uuid-named file
per session on its own branch, recombined when read from every local branch
and every worktree's disk ([worktree
isolation](flows/worktree-isolation.md#4-no-shared-mutable-file)). Held by:
the `coordination` plugin and `src/plugins/coordination/coordination.test.ts`,
and `src/core/git.test.ts` for reading across branches. That every merge to
the trunk is a fast-forward is a flow, not code: not enforced by Naima.

**checked-like-code.** The tracker has invariants, and `naima check` fails
when one breaks, the way a test suite fails when the code breaks. Held by:
`naima check` itself, run by `deno task verify` in this repository and by CI.

**documented-always.** Every feature is documented as part of its
implementation ([the documentation rule](documentation.md)). Held by: the
checks `documented` (every contribution carries its documentation),
`features-documented` (a shipped feature names its page), `links-resolve`
(every relative link in tracked markdown resolves) and `reference-current`
(the generated reference matches the code).

**agent-rules-checked.** Where a rule for people and agents can be checked,
it is ([enforced, not only written](flows/README.md#enforced-not-only-written)):
a person is asked only for what is theirs, a fix names the gesture that
proves it, a branch does not close what it claims on its own tests. Held by:
the checks `human-says-why`, `fix-names-its-gesture` (a note) and
`claims-resolve`, and the write hook `no-closing-own-claims`. The rules of
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/vincenzoml/naima/blob/main/AGENTS.md), the rules for working on Naima, that are judgement, such as when to ask the owner,
are not enforced.

### Non-functional

**no-dependencies.** The core imports only itself and the `node:` built-ins
that Deno, Node and Bun all provide. Nothing is installed. Held by:
`src/arch.test.ts` ("the core imports nothing outside itself but node
built-ins"), and `deno.json`, which has no imports.

**portable-runtime.** The same code runs on Deno, Node and Bun. Held by: CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), which runs the tests on all three, on Linux and
macOS.

**small-fixed-core.** The core names no item type, field, relation, gate,
verifier or plugin; everything above it is a plugin. Held by:
`src/arch.test.ts` ("the core names no plugin's type, field, relation or
plugin"), and the [dependency rule](architecture.md#the-dependency-rule).

**extensible.** A project, or anyone, extends Naima through plugins: types,
statuses, fields, relations, checks, commands, views, gates, verifiers,
migrations ([extension points](plugin-contract.md#extension-points)).
Plugins never import each other; they cooperate through the registry. Held
by: `src/arch.test.ts` (a plugin imports only the core's public API and its
own files), `src/extending.test.ts`, and `src/external.test.ts` for plugins
outside Naima.

**stable-contract.** A plugin says the contract version it is written for; a
newer one is refused rather than half run ([the contract
version](plugin-contract.md#the-contract-version)). Held by:
`src/external.test.ts`.

**offline.** No run touches the network except through git, and only
alignment and `naima update` ask git for it; a normal run never pulls. Held
by: the launcher granting no network permission
([the permissions](install.md#the-permissions), `src/launcher.ts`), and
`src/distribution.test.ts` ("a normal run never pulls").

**contained.** Naima writes nothing in a project outside `naima-tracker/`
(except `.gitmodules` when carried as a submodule), runs only git and the
programs its verifiers declare, and hands the program only an allow-listed
environment. Held by: the launcher's permissions, and the tests in
`src/distribution.test.ts` and `src/launcher.test.ts`.

**reproducible.** Every clone, worktree, colleague and CI run the same Naima:
the one locked by commit in `naima.json`. Alignment never overwrites work and
refuses a commit it cannot reach ([every run aligns the
program](install.md#every-run-aligns-the-program)). Held by:
`src/distribution.test.ts` and `src/core/lock.test.ts`.

**runtime-only-distribution.** A project receives only what runs Naima: no
tests, no CI, no development agent rules, none of Naima's own tracker items
([the dist branch](install.md#the-dist-branch)). Held by: `dist.json`, the
allowlist, and `src/dist.test.ts`, which holds the dist to it.

**forward-migration.** The data has a format number; it moves only with a
migration, forward only and deterministic; newer data is refused and left
untouched ([migrations](format.md#migrations)). Held by:
`src/core/format.test.ts` and the check `one-format`.

**fork-friendly.** The format is the compatibility boundary: a fork that
reads and writes it works on the same data as every other
([the format](format.md), [modifying Naima](install.md#modifying-naima)).
Held by: the format's invariants in `naima check`, and
`src/distribution.test.ts` ("a fork source is honoured once accepted").

## Design principles

**The core does not move.** Like the pedal point in Coltrane's *Naima*, a
bass note held while the harmony changes above it, the core stays small and
still, and everything built on it is free to change. It serves
**extensible** and **fork-friendly**: a project extends Naima without
forking the core, and forks keep sharing the data. The rule is in
[architecture](architecture.md#the-dependency-rule).

**Plain files and git, nothing else.** Files can be read by every tool and
every agent, diffed, reviewed and versioned with the code. Git already
solves storage, history, branching and distribution; Naima adds no second
system to keep in step with it. It serves **plain-files**, **offline** and
**no-shared-mutable-file**.

**Derive, never store.** A stored copy of something computed is a second
truth that will diverge. Computing it when read costs little and removes the
question. It serves **derived-views**.

**A claim is not a proof.** "Fixed" is what someone says; "resolved" is what
evidence shows. Keeping the two apart, and checking the difference, is what
makes a board trustworthy. It serves **three-completion-states** and
**proof-stays-current**.

**Check what can be checked.** A rule written only in prose is forgotten,
most of all by an agent in a new session. Where a rule can be a check, it is
one. It serves **checked-like-code**, **documented-always** and
**agent-rules-checked**.

**Automatic first.** Every first-party plugin is loaded and every default is
inferred from the repository; `naima.json` holds only what cannot be
inferred ([the automatic principle](config.md#the-automatic-principle)).
A project that needs nothing else configures nothing.

**Extension is data, not inheritance.** No object-oriented modelling: no
classes to subclass, no type hierarchy. A type carries plain tags (such as
`fixable`), a field applies to the types that carry a tag, and an extension
adds statuses or values to another plugin's type or field but never
redefines one ([extending](plugin-contract.md#extending-another-plugins-types-and-fields)).
Plain data can be merged, checked and documented; a hierarchy has to be
understood. Held by: `src/extending.test.ts`. That the code has no classes of
its own is a practice, not a check: the only ones are `NaimaError`, which
extends `Error` as JavaScript requires, and the frozen collections of the
registry.

**The fixed on-disk layout is the boundary between forks.** Anything may
change except the files a project holds; that is what keeps every fork on the
same data. It serves **fork-friendly**.

**The installed program holds nothing but what runs Naima.** Test runners,
type-checkers and agent harnesses that walk a project's files would pick up
Naima's tests, CI or agent rules if they were there. So a project clones a
runtime-only branch, and Naima's own development stays on `main`. It serves
**runtime-only-distribution** and **contained**.

**A host's own material lives organised in its naima-data.** Everything a
project keeps about its own work, items, claims, notes, evidence, is in its
`naima-tracker/naima-data/`, in the layout the format fixes, never scattered
through the host or mixed into the program.

**Nothing moves without a reviewable commit.** Updating Naima, changing its
source, carrying it differently: each is an explicit commit in the project.
That is the protection the permissions cannot give against a malicious
update ([what this does not protect](install.md#the-permissions)).

**Don't overthink; iterate version by version.** Choose the simplest design
that fixes the problem at hand, ship it, and extend it in a later version
when a real need appears. The contract version and the migrations exist so
that a later step never breaks what an earlier one wrote.

**Agents are a first audience.** The tool is designed for agents as much as
for people: flows written as procedures, rules checked by the tracker, and a
skill that teaches an agent the tool ([the Naima skill](skill.md)). A
person's time is the most expensive resource in the project, so it is
spent only on what is genuinely theirs
([asking the human](flows/asking-the-human.md)).

## Non-goals

- **Not a hosted service.** There is no server, account or web board. Naima
  runs in the repository, offline.
- **Not a database.** The data is plain files under git; there is no query
  engine, index or store to keep in step.
- **Not a general project-management tool.** No time tracking, no
  estimation charts, no resource planning, no people management. Naima
  tracks the state of software and the evidence for it.
- **Not a CI system.** It runs checks and records evidence; building and
  deploying are left to the project's own pipeline.
- **Not a formal-methods tool.** It runs model checkers through plugins and
  records what they say; it does not prove anything itself.
- **Not a package with releases.** No binaries, no versions to install:
  a project runs one locked commit of Naima's source.
- **Not closed to change.** Changing Naima to fit a project is encouraged; a
  fork is a normal way to use it, not a failure of the design.
