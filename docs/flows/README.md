# Flows for people and AI agents

The written procedures for working on a project that Naima tracks, when some
or all of the work is done by agents. They are general: any project that
adopts Naima can adopt them, and this repository follows them itself.

| Flow | When |
|---|---|
| [Asking the human](asking-the-human.md) | before any question to the owner, and whenever work is handed to a person |
| [Worktree isolation](worktree-isolation.md) | always: the requirement every other flow obeys |
| [The coordinator and the workers](coordinator-and-workers.md) | how a session is staffed |
| [Opening a worktree](opening-a-worktree.md) | starting a piece of work |
| [Closing a worktree](closing-a-worktree.md) | before a branch is merged |
| [Reporting and triage](reporting-and-triage.md) | when something is said, seen or found |

Two words used throughout. The **owner** is the person the project answers
to: the one who decides. The **trunk** is the branch releases come from,
usually `main`.

## As agent commands

[`.claude/commands/flow/`](../../.claude/commands/flow/) holds one command per
flow, for agent harnesses that read commands from the repository (Claude Code
reads that directory as `/flow:<name>`). Each command is a checklist that
points at its page here; where the two disagree, the page wins. To adopt them
in another project, copy the directory, and the pages if the project does not
depend on Naima's docs.

In the commands, `naima` is the CLI. In this repository it is
`npm run naima --`.

## Enforced, not only written

Where a rule can be checked, Naima checks it:

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| a person is asked only for what is theirs | `human-says-why`: an item with `runBy: human` says why in `humanBecause` |
| every fix names the gesture that proves it | `fix-names-its-gesture` (a note) |
| closed means proven | `closed-carries-proof`, and `naima close` refuses anything not resolved |
| a claim names real items | `claims-resolve` |
| a feature is documented as part of its implementation | the [`docs` plugin](../documentation.md) |
| the flows an instruction names exist | `links-resolve`, over the markdown the `docs` plugin is given |

Full list of checks: [reference](../reference.md).
