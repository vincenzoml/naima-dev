# Closing a worktree

Everything that has to be true before a branch is merged, in the order that
makes each step possible. Several steps cannot be done from the trunk
afterwards, and the first is the one most often skipped.

Preparing the branch is the developer's work. Deciding that it may enter the
trunk is a separate call: whoever wrote the code does not also decide it
ships.

## 1. Every fix names the gesture that would prove it

The fix feels finished when the tests are green. It is not resolved until
something proves it, and that something must be visible to the board: a test
item linked `verifies`, not a checkbox inside the fixed item's own page.

```sh
naima new tests "Export keeps the alpha channel" --set runBy=agent
naima link export-keeps verifies export-drops
```

Write the gesture so someone who was not in this session can perform it:
where to be, what to do, what must appear — and the negative half whenever
the fix has one, because a rule that always fires is the same defect the
other way round. Set `runBy` by the instrument that settles it; a person's
gesture also says `humanBecause` ([asking the human](asking-the-human.md)).

A test nobody can find is a test nobody runs: triage it like any item.

## 2. Triage what is left open

You are the last person who looked at these items. Set what you know;
`effort` especially, which nobody else can:

```sh
naima triage missing
naima triage set <item> effort=M
```

## 3. Release the claims — from the worktree

```sh
naima release <item>...
```

`release` acts on the branch you are standing on. Run from the trunk after
the merge, it would release the trunk's claims and leave the branch's behind.
It deletes your own claim file and commits nothing: commit the deletion on the
branch, so it rides the same fast-forward as the work.

Claims outlive their work when someone forgets. Release another branch's claim
only when both hold: nothing is being worked on there, and nothing is
unlanded. Neither test alone is enough — a gone worktree can still have an
unmerged branch, and a merged branch can still have a live session working on
it. The one mechanical case is a claim naming a branch git no longer has:

```sh
naima prune            # list them
naima prune --write    # remove them, then commit the deletions
```

## 4. Write the session note

```sh
naima pass "what changed, what is proven, what is left"
```

One file of your own, on your own branch, committed with the work. A fresh
reader of only that note must know what landed, what is still unproven, and
what to pick up next. Say what was **not** verified — that sentence is worth
more than the list of what was. Never rewrite another session's note, and
never number yours.

## 5. Run the gates, and read what breaks

The project's full gate set, including `naima check`. A red result that
arrives with the trunk is not yours to absorb silently: prove where it comes
from (a detached worktree at the trunk settles it in one command), and if it
is the trunk's, open an item and say so in the session note.

## 6. Merge the trunk into the branch

```sh
git merge --no-edit main
git merge-base --is-ancestor main HEAD && echo "fast-forward ready"
```

This is what makes the merge back a fast-forward. Resolve conflicts here,
where the context is. Then run step 5 again: the merge brought code you have
not tested with yours.

## 7. Hand it over

Say: the merge command, that it fast-forwards, what arrives red and from
where, and what is left open with its gesture. The merge itself:

```sh
git merge --ff-only <branch>
```

If it refuses, stop ([worktree isolation](worktree-isolation.md), rule 3).

## 8. Only then, remove the worktree

```sh
git worktree remove <path>
```

## Not part of closing

- **Closing the branch's own items.** An item is closed once it is fixed
  *and* proven by a gesture, and a branch that closes its own items on the
  strength of its own green tests is marking its own homework. `naima close`
  refuses anything that is not resolved, and refuses an item the branch you
  stand on claims: close it from the trunk, after the merge, once someone
  else has checked the proof. `naima close --force` is for the one who owns
  the evidence — a proof someone else performed, recorded here.
- **Deleting the scratchpad.** It was never tracked.
