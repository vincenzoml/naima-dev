# Concepts

## Items

Every item — a bug, a task, a feature, a test, a property — is a directory
under the tracker:

```
naima-tracker/naima-data/<type>/<slug>/README.md       the prose
naima-tracker/naima-data/<type>/<slug>/meta.json       the fields
naima-tracker/naima-data/<type>/<slug>/attachments/    the evidence
```

`meta.json` always holds `id` (a permanent uuid), `title` and `status`; the
rest are fields declared by plugins. The slug is a readable name made from
the title's words in whatever script they are written (Latin letters lose their
accents; Cyrillic, CJK and every other letter are kept), and may
change; the id never does, and links hold ids. On the command line an item is
named by its id, `type/slug`, its slug, or any fragment of a slug that matches
exactly one item.

Which types, statuses and fields exist depends on the loaded plugins:
[reference](reference.md). Each status is in the `open` or the `done`
category; a status may also `prove` — count as evidence for whatever the item
`verifies`.

## Links

A link is `{ "rel": "<relation>", "id": "<uuid>" }` in the item's `links`.
Only the direction written is stored; the inverse (`verifies` ↔ `verified-by`,
`blocks` ↔ `blocked-by`) is derived when read, so the two can never disagree.

## Fixed, resolved, closed

Three states that are not synonyms:

- **fixed** — the code exists: `fixedOn` is set. Nothing is proven.
- **resolved** — fixed, and proven by an item that `verifies` it and whose
  status proves: a test that passed, a property that holds.
- **closed** — resolved, and moved to the archive by `naima close`, carrying
  its proof.

A status may instead **refute** — a failed test, a violated property: then
the item it verifies is not resolved whatever else proves it, and it blocks
every gate the two are on. `naima close` also refuses a proof `naima check`
reports as no longer current.

"How many bugs are left" is the unfixed count (`naima bugs`); fixed-but-
unproven is a different number, and the two are never added.

## Evidence

Evidence travels with the claim, in the item's `attachments/`. A property
checked by a formal-methods tool is evidence exactly as a passed test is:
`naima verify` attaches the run and the hash of the model it ran on, and
`naima check` fails when the model, or the property, verifier or options it
was run with, has changed since.

## Derived, never stored

Boards, queues, gate states, urgency and summaries are computed when asked
and never written, so no stored copy can go stale. `naima check` holds the
whole tracker to its invariants, the way a test suite holds the code.

## Gates

A gate is a named condition — a release, a merge — backed by items: an item
joins a gate by carrying `gate: <name>`. How each gate decides is in the
[reference](reference.md#gates).

## Coordination across branches

State that belongs to no single branch — who is working on what, where each
session left off — is written as one file per session on that session's own
branch, and recombined when read from the trunk, every unmerged branch and
every worktree's working copy. Two sessions never edit one file. The flows
that go with it: [flows](flows/README.md).
