$ARGUMENTS

Flow: [reporting and triage](../../../docs/flows/reporting-and-triage.md) —
it owns the routing table.

1. **Write it before you understand it**: `naima new <type> "<what happened>"`.
   Broken → `bugs`; work → `todos`; wanted → `features`; to be tried → `tests`.
2. **The page carries**: the words verbatim, the evidence, measured apart from
   inferred, the consequence.
3. **Triage it now**: `naima triage set <item> impact=… priority=… confidence=…`.
   `effort` only if you have looked at the code.
4. **Link, don't repeat**: `naima link <a> <relation> <b>`.
5. `naima check`.

"I already told you" means it was lost: write it now and say it was missing.
